## About Me

I am currently a 2021 Computing Innovations Fellow and Postdoctoral Researcher at Tulane University, supervised by Dr. Nicholas Mattei. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in August 2021, advised by Dr. Elliot Anshelevich. My current research is in the areas of algorithmic game theory, mechanism design, computational social choice, and multi-agent systems. Broadly speaking, my interests lie at the intersection of my three undergraduate majors: mathematics, computer science, and economics.
